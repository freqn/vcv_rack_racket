# VCV Rack Racket

For sharing of racks (.vcv) files, libraries and eventually custom modules.

## Using/Contributing racks

Contributed/shared racks are found in the `racks/` with their own README/documentation. If you share a rack, please create a folder named after your rack in `racks/` with any applicable 3rd party module instuctions (via readme) along with your rack (the .vcv file that you save from the application).
