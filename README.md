# VCV Rack Racket

For sharing of your unique VCV Rack patches (.vcv) files, libraries and eventually custom modules.

## Using/Contributing racks

Clone the repo. Contributed/shared patches are found in the `racks` directory with their own README/documentation. If you share a patch, do so inside a folder named after your patch in the `racks` directory with any 3rd party module information (via README.md).
