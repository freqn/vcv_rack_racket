# VCV Rack Racket

For sharing of racks (.vcv) files, libraries and eventually custom modules.

## Using/Contributing racks

Contributed/shared racks are found in the `racks` directory with their own README/documentation. If you share a rack, create a folder named after your rack in the `racks` directory with any 3rd party module information (via README.md) along with your rack (the .vcv file that saved from the application).
